            <p class="comment">On the Apple website, users are typically presented with a limited number of main
                categories, making it easy for them to navigate and find information about products, services,
                and
                support. The homepage often features key product highlights, and users can explore specific
                product
                categories with clear and concise <br>
                <br>
                By limiting the number of choices and maintaining a clean design, Apple aims to enhance user
                experience
                and facilitate quicker decision-making for visitors seeking information or making a purchase.
                This
                approach aligns with the principles of Hick's Law, helping users navigate the site efficiently
                without
                feeling overwhelmed by excessive options.

            <h4 class="companyName">look at the <u>Microsoft Corp.</u> official website</h4>
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" class="webLink">microsoft.com</a>
            <img src="images/screen2.jpg" class="webScreen" alt="microsoft homepage narrow screen shot">
            <p class="comment">Fitt's Law suggests that the time required to move to a target (such as a
                button or link)
                is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. In the context of
                web design, it
                implies that larger and more accessible targets are easier for users to interact with. A
                company that
                effectively applies Fitt's Law to its website design is Microsoft. <br><br>
                While website designs can evolve, as of my last update, Microsoft's website is an example of
                a company
                that strategically incorporates Fitt's Law principles to create a user-friendly and
                accessible
                experience.

            <p class="comment">Amazon.com official website strikes a user with highcontrast white letters of

                logo and other navbar buttons with dark-dark blue (almost black) stripe at hte very top of

                <br><br>Other quite contrasting colors are used through the page, like navy and pistachio
                green.
